    <h2>Butterflies and Months</h2>
    <p>
        There are about 1,251 species of butterflies and at least 8,000 species of moths. Butterflies and moths are common year round but are more present during the rainy season. Ten percent of known butterfly species worldwide reside in Costa Rica. Costa Rican butterflies and moths have made amazing adaptations to the environment. Some examples of these are the following:

        <ul> 
        <li>Swallowtail caterpillars imitate bird droppings and many others have bright colours to warn predators of bodily toxins.</li> 
        <li>What someone could easily mistake for a butterfly, a wasp, or a leaf in Costa Rica might be a moth engaging in MÃ¼llerian or Batesian mimicry.</li>
        
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Ecotourism is one of Costa Rica's primary economic resources, and the country's butterflies add a lot to that. They bring life to tropical forests, not only with the diversity in colour, but with the magnificence of the flowers that they help pollinate. Some examples of butterfly species are:
        <ul> 
            <li>Thoas swallowtail</li>
            <li>Marpesia berania</li>
            <li>Doxocopa laure</li>
            <li>Banded peacock</li>
        </ul>
